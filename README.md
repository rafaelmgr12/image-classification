## üõ∏ How to run it
Clone this repository and access its directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaelmgr12/image-classification.git
cd image-classification
```

Now to start, use the following commands
```bash
  # install depedencies
  yarn
  # init project
  yarn start
```

The app will be available in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Remembering that it will be necessary to create an account on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and a project to deploy on web.

## ü§ñ Project

This Project was made for my interest in machine learning. The pre-trained model was chosen was [mobilenet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861), for classification/identification of objects. You can find more information on how to implement this model [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet).

This project can be found at this [link](https://image-classify-4ed0f.web.app/).

##  üë£ Next Steps
- [ ] Add Typescript
- [ ] Add Styled Components
- [ ] Add New models
